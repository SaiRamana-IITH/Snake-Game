This Python project implements a classic Snake Game using the Pygame library. The game features a snake that the player controls to eat food and grow in length while avoiding collisions with the game boundaries and itself. The Snake Game provides a simple and interactive experience, showcasing the basics of game development with Pygame.

Features:
Snake Movement: Control the snake's direction using arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
Scoring: Earn points by eating the red food items that randomly appear on the screen.
Collision Detection: Avoid collisions with the game boundaries and the snake's own body.
Sound Effects: Enjoy immersive sound effects for eating food and game over scenarios.
How to Play:
Use arrow keys to navigate the snake.
Eat red food items to score points.
Avoid collisions with the game boundaries and the snake's body.
The game ends when a collision occurs, and your final score is displayed.
